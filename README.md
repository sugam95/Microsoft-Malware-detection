# Microsoft-Malware-detection
1. This problem is related to detecting the malicious software in which data is provided by the microsoft.
2. In this solution we make made use of machine learning algos to solve this problem in whcih we have came up with different features which we have extracted from data and have experiment with different machine learning models.
3. Finally we have build the model using xgboost and trained our extracted engineered features data which is providing best results.
4. In this solution we are getting log-loss of approx. 0.009 with zero number of misclassified points in our test data with our final model.
